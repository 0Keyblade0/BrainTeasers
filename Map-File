;;; Apply a Function to Each Line in a File (Common Lisp)
;;;
;;; This code defines a utility function `map-file` that takes a function and a file path,
;;; then applies the function to each line of the file.
;;;
;;; - `map-file`: Opens the file at `pathname` for reading, and applies `function`
;;;               to each line using a helper function `map-stream`.
;;; - `map-stream` is assumed to be a function that maps a given function over
;;;                each line (or element) of the stream.
;;;
;;; Example use case: Counting lines, filtering content, transforming text line-by-line.

(defun map-file (function pathname)
  (with-open-file (stream pathname :direction :input)
    (map-stream function stream)))
